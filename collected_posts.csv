"On Monday night Bernie Sanders released a video aimed at disaffected left-wingers who see the war in Gaza as a top issue, will his words sway them?","Senator Bernie Sanders put out a video on Monday that is aimed at left-wing voters that feel they can't vote for Kamala due to the conflict in Gaza.

[YouTube - Bernie Sanders: “I disagree with Kamala’s position on the war in Gaza. How can I vote for her?” Here is my answer:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf5MThSniiY) (Transcript in comments)

He makes the case that even though Harris and Biden's position isn't ideal, they are far better than Trump on the Gaza. 
He says Netanyahu would much prefer Trump in office, ""who is extremely close to Netanyahu and sees him as a like-minded, right wing extremist ally.""

He also makes the case that there are other issues at stake in this election, such as women's bodily autonomy, climate change, and wealth inequality.

If Senator Sanders correct in his views?

Will this video change any minds among those who view the Biden-Harris administration in too negative a light to vote for Kamala Harris?",1078,0.94,982,2024-10-30 04:41:05,1gfepbg,PoliticalDiscussion,0.5,2,7

Obviously many voters will not be swayed by this. Are there those that will? And will it turn them away from Trump, or make them reject the accusation and hence change their voting behavior that way?",1019,0.87,1450,2024-10-24 14:17:02,1gb3oj9,PoliticalDiscussion,0.3,4,0
"FiveThirtyEight is currently giving Republicans a 90% chance of winning the Senate. If Kamala Harris is elected president, what can she do with a Republican Senate?","Senator Jon Tester is in probably the most difficult battle of his political life. The longtime statesman from Montana is one of the last prominent Democrats in the region. Multiple election analysts are now predicting his defeat. Notably, [FiveThirtyEight is giving him an 11% chance of winning in November](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/senate/).

If Tester falls and the Democratic seat in West Virginia (almost certainly) goes to a Republican, then the GOP will have a 51-49 majority in the Senate for the next session. This is assuming a best case scenario in which other vulnerable Senators like Sherrod Brown, Tammy Baldwin, and Bob Casey keep their seats. There is an outside chance that the GOP might lose Texas or Florida, but it seems unlikely.

If this happens and Kamala Harris is elected president, it would be the first time in decades that a president was elected with an opposition Congress. What could President Harris even do?

"Trump has become increasingly threatening lately with claims of ""enemies within"" threatening to weaponize the DOJ and even using the national guard and military to get even and calling for special military tribunals.

If he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?

Some of those who have worked closely with him in the past and others who have faced the wrath of Trump believe he is quite capable of following through with his threats. Others, like Johnson \[Speaker of the House\] have dismissed his comments as jest and comical or otherwise tried to rationalize it.

He has often threatened what he has described as democrats and leftists, but also named Nancy Pelosi and Adma Schiff specifically \[among others\].

On [Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmmx1zQCQds&t=485s), Trump expressed support for using government force against domestic political rivals. Since 2022, when he began preparing for the presidential campaign, Trump has issued more than 100 threats to investigate, prosecute, imprison or otherwise punish his perceived opponents, NPR has found.

A review of Trump’s rally speeches, press conferences, interviews and social media posts shows that the former president has repeatedly indicated that he would use federal law enforcement as part of a campaign to exact “[retribution](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/109967829299924979).”

Vice President Kamala Harris “should be impeached and prosecuted,” Trump [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgdVgxxELbQ&t=1590s) at a rally last month.

“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump [said](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/bFORNS0mvNOxmr9cbwwpUJRzq-pofVnRhYN3vHJKQdeiFjefDAKwDpPowHng3r_kHNX-RDMkd2KrzETglXlCPsGi_Wk?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1706.4) last year.

Journalists who decline to identify the sources of leaked information would also face imprisonment, Trump said.

When right-wing radio host Glenn Beck asked Trump if he would lock up his opponents in a second term, Trump [responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lywHT5uH71M&t=124s), “The answer is you have no choice because they’re doing it to us.”

Legal experts said that there are few guardrails preventing Trump from pursuing his plans to prosecute opponents and noted that Trump pressured the Department of Justice to investigate rivals during his first term. In about a dozen cases, the Justice Department followed through and initiated investigations, according to one [analysis](https://www.justsecurity.org/98703/chronology-trump-justice-department/).

If he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?

"Trump Suggests Using Military Against ""Enemy From Within"": What Are the Implications for Civil-Military Relations?","In a recent statement, former President Trump suggested using the military against what he describes as an ""enemy from within."" This proposal raises significant questions about the role of the military in domestic affairs and the potential consequences for civil-military relations.



-Background: Historically, the U.S. military has been largely kept out of domestic law enforcement to maintain civilian control and prevent the militarization of domestic issues. Trump's comments come amid a polarized political climate and ongoing discussions about national security and civil liberties.



- Discussion Points:

  1. What are the potential risks of deploying military forces for domestic issues?

  2. How could this affect public perception of the military?

  3. What historical precedents exist for military involvement in domestic affairs?

  4. Are there alternative approaches to address perceived internal threats without military intervention?

"The Washington Post announced today that it will not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s, citing historical tradition of neutrality.

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play?

Before the 1990s Most Conservatives Were Pro-Choice. Why Did the Dramatic Change Occur? Was It the Embrace of Christianity?,"A few months ago, I asked on here a question about abortion and Pro-Life and their ties to Christianity. Many people posted saying that they were Atheist conservatives and being Pro-Life had nothing to do with religion.

However, doing some research I noticed that historically most Conservatives were pro-choice. It seems to argument for being Pro-Choice was that Government had no right to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her body. This seems to be the small-government decision.

Roe V. Wade itself was passed by a heavily Republican seem court headed by Republican Chief Justice Warren E. Burger as well as Justices Harry Blackmun, Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist.

Not only that but Mr. Conservative himself Barry Goldwater was Pro-Choice. As were Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, the Rockefellers, etc as were most Republican Congressmen, Senators and Governors in the 1950s, 60s, 70s and into the 80s.

While not really Pro-Choice or Pro-Life himself to Ronald Reagan abortion was kind of a non-issue. He spent his administration with other issues.

However, in the late 80s and 90s the Conservatives did a 180 and turned full circle into being pro-life. The rise of Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan and the Bush family, it seems the conservatives became pro-life and heavily so. Same with the conservative media through Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, etc.

How will the January 6 dossier affect Trump’s White House bid?,"A month from election day, startling allegations have emerged about the Republican nominee’s actions during the 2021 Capitol riot.

The publication on Wednesday night of a dossier of evidence alleging that Donald Trump “resorted to crimes” in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election certainly fits the bill as this year’s first example.

The 165-page brief compiled by the special counsel Jack Smith provides detailed records of private conversations involving Trump in the build-up to and during the storming of the US Capitol by his supporters on January 6, 2021.

How will this impact him in the election?

What are your thoughts on the quiet Trump voter?,"The idea is that many people secretly vote for Trump but won't admit or discuss it with others (including pollsters) because they are afraid of being harassed or attacked. 

TL;DR anecdotal ""evidence"" incoming so take this for the grain of salt it's worth:

I live on a *light* blue island in the middle of a deep red state.  In 2016, there were almost zero Trump signs and his hardocre supporters seemed very much the random kooky outlier types.  However, if you had conservative friends (of which I have many) and you were someone they didn't fear judgement from, they would usually quietly say tell you they were voting for him over Clinton. To me at least, this seems to represent the classic ""silent"" Trump supporters.

Fast forward to now and -at least in my suburban/rural part of the world- it seems as if the tables are totally flipped; people who support Harris keep their political views more to themselves or their social media echospheres largely because they're afraid of the (possibly violent) response they may elicit. At the same time, pro-Trump & anti-liberal bumper stickers, yard signs, and flags pepper T-shirts, vehicles, and front yards.

Is it different in large cities or other parts of the country? Do Trump supporters still tend to be more politically private? Or is that concept a thing of past?",274,0.86,501,2024-10-11 19:56:43,1g1ikrn,PoliticalDiscussion,0.0,5,1

"Which protest vote is going to sway the election more, the Democrats not voting for Harris because of the Gaza issue, or the Republicans not voting for Trump because of the MAGA issue? ","There are a lot of issues on the table that people are considering this election: economy, abortion, immigration, wars, and on and on. 

But there are also people who are voting on other than the hot button issues. The moral vote, or the protest vote. And each party seems to have a prominent division based on this moral vote. 

On the Republican side, whether it’s the Republican Veterans Against Trump (RVAT), Never Trumpers, Lincoln project, etc, what they all have in common is that they’re all republicans who will tell you that they have a moral obligation to not vote for Trump. This Republican faction is what delivered Biden the 2020 win. 

On the Democratic side, you have a segment of the Democratic Party who are planning not to vote for Harris because of her stance on the Gaza issue. While this issue casts a wide net demographically, it mostly consists of Muslims, Arab Americans, and black Americans who find themselves deeply connected with this issue. Of course, Trump won’t be any better on this issue but this is a faction of would-be Democrats, so they wouldn’t vote for Trump anyway. 

So, what faction is a bigger threat to their respective parties? The never Trump republicans not voting for Trump, or the Gaza protesters not voting for Harris?

"If Donald Trump loses the 2024 election and flees the country to escape prosecution, would it end or significantly harm the MAGA movement?","It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Was Trump really responsible for the good economy during his term?,"According to [Pew Research data](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/), the top issue among voters in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election is ""Economy.""

Voters were also polled on which candidate they believe will do a better job on the economy, with more voters believing Trump would make good decisions about economic policy (55%) over Harris (45%). [Gallup data](https://news.gallup.com/poll/644750/confidence-biden-economic-stewardship-historically-low.aspx) also seems to support this as independents polled responded they feel more confident Trump would do the right thing for the economy than they feel Biden would (45% vs. 34%).

A possible explanation for these findings is due to the belief among voters that Trump was responsible for the good economy during his term, and not due to other significant irrelevant factors (such as simply inheriting the good economy from Obama's term as some have argued).

So is it true? Is Trump really responsible for the good economy during his term? Is it reasonable to hold that belief and consequently feel he would be better on the economy than Harris?",164,0.73,381,2024-10-24 22:12:04,1gbev64,PoliticalDiscussion,0.44999999999999996,4,2

Will a Republican-controlled Senate confirm Democrat SCOTUS picks at all?,"Due to Mitch McConnell's power politics, there are few reliable rules of comity left in the U.S. Senate; he notably simply refused to consider Obama's pick of Merrick Garland for SCOTUS, enlarging without any attempt at justification a previous soft rule about lateness in the presidential term.

Which of the 9 longest red streaking states do you think will be the first to flip?,"All throughout history, we've had many instances where certain states which were said to be aligned to a certain party stronghold end up facing a political realignment that causes it to permanently flip.

That being said, some states haven't changed political alignments at all for many decades.

The US, one of Israel's closest allies, said Saturday's strike against Israel was an ""exercise of self-defense"".

* Washington was given a heads-up but was not involved in the Israeli strikes, three US officials told NBC News.
* At least some of the blasts heard in Tehran were caused by the *“defense activity,”* a security source told IRNA, insisting the Iranian air defenses successfully repelled the attack.
* Israel has so far limited its strike to Iranian *“military targets,”* an Israeli official told NBC News. *“We’re targeting things that might have threatened us in the past or could do in the future,”* the official said.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was directing the attacks from a secure complex in IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, according to Israeli media. 

Over 100 planes were involved in the 2000 k.m. attack, including the cutting-edge F-35, according to Walla.

There were reports of widespread internet outages across Iran as the attacks continued. ""The IDF is currently attacking precise targets in Iran,"" IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement. ""This is in response to persisting attacks by the Iranian regime on the State of Israel.

What is a blue and red state which will likely never flip in an election?,"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?",99,0.9,201,2024-10-12 05:15:00,1g1t2x7,PoliticalDiscussion,0.0,0,0

Joe Walsh’s Political Reckoning: How Do We View Public Figures Who Admit They Were Wrong?,"Joe Walsh, former Tea Party congressman and right-wing radio host, has gone through a significant public transformation in recent years. After years of contributing to the extreme rhetoric that dominated conservative media, he’s now admitted that he was wrong and is genuinely trying to make amends for the harm he helped cause. He’s been vocal about his regret, even starting a podcast where he consistently bashes the modern Republican Party and Trump, and repeatedly beats himself down for his past aggressive support of both. It really seems like a true “come to Jesus” moment, where Walsh is fully aware of the damage he’s done and is trying to reconcile with it.

But despite this intense self-reflection, his shift has largely made him irrelevant in the political landscape. My question is: How do we view someone like Walsh, who was once so loud and influential in shaping harmful narratives but has since tried to fix what he did? Is this kind of reckoning enough? Do public figures deserve credit for trying to right their wrongs, or is it too little, too late? What impact do you think Walsh’s shift really has, if any?

It also makes me wonder—how much of this is just a universal challenge for republics and democracies?

- Biden and Harris both campaigned on an assault weapon buyback program in 2020 that Harris has dropped for the 2024 campaign.

However, once early and mail in ballots were counted, Trumps lead disappeared and he lost.

"(New York Times) How One Polling Decision Is Leading to Two Distinct Stories of the Election.
A methodological choice has created divergent paths of polling results. Is this election more like 2020 or 2022?","***Source***: [*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html) ***(Paywall)***

Over the last month, one methodological decision seems to have produced two parallel universes of political polling.

In one universe, Kamala Harris leads only narrowly in the national popular vote against Donald J. Trump, even as she holds a discernible edge in the Northern battlegrounds. The numbers look surprisingly similar to the 2022 midterm election.

In the other, Ms. Harris has a clear lead in the national vote, but the battlegrounds are very tight. It’s essentially a repeat of the 2020 election.

This divide is almost entirely explained by whether a pollster uses “weighting on recalled vote,” which means trying to account for how voters *say* they voted in the last election.

Here’s how it works. First, the pollster asks respondents whether they voted for Joe Biden or Mr. Trump in the last election. Then they use a statistical technique called weighting, in which pollsters give more or less “weight” to respondents from different demographic groups, such that each group represents its actual share of the population. In this case, the pollster weights the number of Biden ’20 or Trump ’20 voters to match the outcome of the last election.

This approach had long been considered a mistake. For reasons we’ll explain, pollsters have avoided it over the years. But they increasingly do it today, partly as a way to try to make sure they have enough Trump supporters after high-profile polling misfires in 2016 and 2020. The choice has become an important fault line among pollsters in this election, and it helps explain the whiplash that poll watchers are experiencing from day to day.

**Over the last month, about two-thirds of polls were weighted by recalled vote.**

An important — and perhaps obvious — consequence of weighting by recalled vote is that it makes poll results look more like the 2020 election results. The polls that don’t do it\*,\* including New York Times/Siena College surveys, are more likely to show clear changes from four years ago.

While the differences between the two sets of polls are relatively small, they add up to two different stories of the election. The polls that *don’t* weight on past vote tend to show results that align more closely with the result of the 2022 midterm election than the last presidential election. They also show that Mr. Trump’s advantage in the Electoral College, with respect to the popular vote, has dwindled over the last four years. The polls weighted on past vote, on the other hand, show little more than a 2020 repeat of the Electoral College gap.

As we’ll see, this is a fraught decision for pollsters. On one hand, weighting on recalled vote would have produced worse results in every presidential election from 2004 to 2020. On the other, it’s the choice that might save pollsters from underestimating Mr. Trump yet again.

**Why this kind of weighting is controversial**

When I started following polling methodology debates 20 years ago, weighting on recalled vote was considered a very bad idea. A surprising number of respondents don’t remember how they voted; they seem likelier to remember voting for the winner; and they sometimes report voting when voting records show they did not.

This pattern has persisted all the way from the first time I read about recall vote all the way to the present, based on data archived at the Roper Center and 2021-24 data from the Pew Research Center and Times/Siena. The same pattern shows up in the exit polls in every presidential election year when it was asked (2004, 2008, 2020).

The tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the last election means that weighting on recall vote has a predictable effect: It increases support for the party that lost the last election.

While polls have a lot of issues, underestimating the party that lost the last election doesn’t turn out to be one of them. As a result, weighting on recalled vote would have made the polls less accurate in every election since 2004 (the farthest back considered), based on a re-analysis of 70 polls archived at the Roper Center.

The effect of recall vote in 2020 is especially revealing: The polls that year were so poor that there are individual cases where recall-vote weighting would have helped. For example, it would have produced a smaller lead for Mr. Biden in ABC/Washington Post’s [infamous poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/28/power-up-new-post-abc-polling-shows-biden-with-big-lead-wisconsin-where-coronavirus-cases-are-rising/) showing him leading by 17 points in Wisconsin in October 2020. But it wouldn’t have fixed it, either; by our estimate, it would have still shown Mr. Biden up 12 if recall vote had been used when producing the result. And it would have made most other 2020 polls less accurate, on average, including Times/Siena polls and most of the other ABC/Post polls.

What does it mean if recall vote wouldn’t have been enough to fix the polls four years ago? The most straightforward interpretation: For the 2020 polls to be right, pollsters needed the 2016 recall vote to look “wrong.” The polls needed Mr. Trump to hold a clear lead on recall vote — exactly what one would have expected historically, given the tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the previous election.

As a result, recalled vote didn’t even help the polls in the biggest polling misfire in 40 years.

**Why pollsters now weight on recall vote**

Despite that record, many pollsters have decided to weight on recall vote for four main reasons.

First, many pollsters believe recall vote is more reliable than it used to be. Whether it’s accurate enough is another question, but it’s certainly true that recall vote looks “closer” to the last election result than in prior cycles. The last three years of Times/Siena and Pew Research NPORS data show about a three-point gap between recalled 2020 vote and the actual 2020 result, a far cry from the double-digit differences a decade or two ago.

Why could recall vote be getting more accurate? One possibility is that poll respondents have become more likely to remember whom they voted for in the last election, thanks to rising political engagement and polarization. Another possibility is that data collected online may be less vulnerable to whatever it is that causes the “winner bias” (importantly, almost all the reanalyzed polls — where we produced estimates of what a poll’s result might be if it had used recall-vote weighting — were telephone surveys).

This election also features a novel case: The loser of the last election is running again (and most Republicans don’t even believe he lost), and the winner of the last election just lost a rematch, in a sense, against that loser. It’s anyone’s guess how all of this affects the accuracy of recall vote, but it is easy to imagine further mitigation of the traditional “winner bias.”

Second, some pollsters use panels of repeat survey-takers, which means they have responses from them over a long period. A pollster may have asked panelists in 2020 how they voted, as opposed to asking them today to remember how they voted four years ago. This counts as weighting on past vote, but it’s not quite the same as someone’s recalled vote. This approach ought to be less vulnerable to the biases in recall-vote weighting, even if there are still challenges involved — like what to do about any new panelists or changes in the makeup of the electorate since 2020.

Third, recall vote can be used to bludgeon self-evidently unrepresentative data toward a more plausible result. This is especially useful for survey designs with no plausible case for validity, like a poll of people from a single social media platform. No one expects such an approach to yield a good sample, but recall-vote weighting can quickly get it into the ballpark. Indeed, more than 80 percent of opt-in online panel polls weight on recall vote, while other kinds of polls are less likely to do so.

Fourth, recall vote is being used to help address the tendency for polls to understate Mr. Trump’s strength over the last eight years.

As mentioned earlier, weighting on recall vote historically helps the candidate who lost the last election. This year, that’s Mr. Trump. You can see it for yourself in the last round of Times/Siena battleground state polls — almost all of them would have scooted to the right if they had been weighted by recall vote:

**How recent Times/Siena polls would have changed**

* Pennsylvania: Harris +4 (without recall vote) —> Trump +1 (with recall vote)
* Michigan: Harris +1 —> Trump +1
* Wisconsin: Harris +2 —> Trump +1
* North Carolina: Trump +3 —> Trump +6
* Arizona: Trump +5 —> Trump +3
* Georgia: Trump +4 —> Trump +6

Of course, the recall-vote-weighted poll results here represent an entirely plausible outcome. If the polls underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did four or eight years ago, November’s results might look exactly like this. But historically, it’s not surprising that weighting on recall vote would help Republicans: Mr. Trump lost the last election; as such, weighting on recall vote would be expected to give more weight to Trump ’20 voters, and therefore to Mr. Trump today.

When big-name traditional pollsters weight by recall vote, this is usually the reason. Some of these pollsters think it’s a perfectly valid measure, but many only use it grudgingly. They still more or less believe the old arguments against recall vote, but they choose to employ it anyway. They wouldn’t be doing it if they trusted their data to produce unbiased results, and they wouldn’t be doing it if it didn’t shift their polls toward Mr. Trump.

As Patrick Murray of the Monmouth poll put it in [explaining](https://x.com/PollsterPatrick/status/1824477952043618633) his decision to weight on recall vote, “The Trump phenomenon is sui generis, and you have to pick your poison.”

**Did recall vote fix past problems?**

There is some good news contained in this story: Recall-vote weighting is almost certainly reducing the risk that the polls systematically underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did in 2016 or 2020. As we’ve shown, it has given many pollsters a quick and easy fix to move their numbers toward the right.

Many of the worst survey results of the 2020 election seem unlikely to be repeated this time around. For instance, The Washington Post and CNN/SSRS state polls now weight by recall vote, which means we won’t be seeing any results like Biden +17 in Wisconsin or Biden +16 nationwide.

But there’s a strange contradiction between the two major observations so far — and the contradiction points toward real trade-offs involving recall-vote weighting.

On the one hand, many pollsters are weighting on recall vote because it yields more Republican-leaning results.

On the other, the polls weighted like this aren’t necessarily producing especially Republican-leaning results. They don’t look like the hypothetical recall-weighted Times/Siena polls, for instance. Instead, they’re producing results neatly in line with the result of the 2020 election.

**How is that possible? There are two basic possibilities.**

One is that the polls weighted on recall vote are full of highly engaged voters who haven’t shifted since 2020, and therefore weighting on recall vote will produce a 2020 repeat.

Another possibility: It may be employed selectively by pollsters concerned their data is too far to the left. The two theories could be connected, as highly engaged voters have leaned left during the Trump era. Weighting on recall vote, then, would move a group of relatively Democratic-leaning samples neatly in line with the 2020 election result.

Whatever the explanation, this tension suggests significant trade-offs as pollsters weight on recall vote. Most obviously, it may make it harder to identify any changes since the last election. One reason is simply because recall-vote weighting mechanically forces polls toward the last election result. But even deeper than that, the technique is being used, at least in part, because pollsters don’t trust their survey results. It’s an attitude that can lead pollsters to treat surprising and unusual data as suspicious, rather than potentially newsworthy or insightful. This is understandable: I know I don’t always trust our survey results after the last decade of polling misfires. But when legitimate concern about polling morphs into weighting away otherwise outlying findings, it risks squelching any indication of anything that might be out of the ordinary.

In a way, the problem is reminiscent of something [called “herding,”](https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Herding-508.pdf) in which pollsters tweak their surveys to bring their results into alignment with the average of other polls. Like herding, the decision to weight on past vote is often a reflection of how pollsters feel about the quality of their underlying data. In this case, however, pollsters aren’t necessarily herding toward what other pollsters say. Instead, they’re essentially herding toward the result of the last presidential election.

A near repeat of the last presidential election is certainly a plausible outcome. In today’s polarized era, who could possibly be surprised by a repeat in Mr. Trump’s third presidential run? If it’s a near repeat, the polls weighted by recall vote won’t just have an excellent night themselves, but they might also spare the entire industry another four years of misery.

But if this election is different, in any direction, this year’s polls might not be able to see it coming.",65,0.9,31,2024-10-11 12:46:32,1g18y0x,PoliticalDiscussion,0.3121212121212121,27,7

Why do farm labor unions receive little to no political capital?,"For the past several years, manufacturing labor unions, particularly from the auto industry, received widespread attention from media, politicians, and interest groups. These unions sought better pay, working conditions, leave policies, and much more. They threatened, and at times did, respond with crippling strikes to some of the US' largest companies. And for good reason--this country prides on its blue collar workers and with so many electoral votes up for grabs in rust belt states, it makes sense that national politicians play a key role in mediating these discussions. Historically, these jobs paid good wages and provided great benefits as a result of these unions which is a token of immense pride. Lately, successes in these unions have spurred numerous other strikes to spread to other industries like aviation, shipping, and even at Netflix. Collective agreements have been formed in companies that never thought to respond to them as well like at Starbucks. 

  
However, why haven't farmers, farm laborers, and their respective unions been afforded the same attention? Every state surely has thousands of farm workers and agriculture is arguably a critical industry for the country. ",62,0.87,12,2024-10-31 02:31:46,1gg4ceb,PoliticalDiscussion,-0.09375,0,0

# Bottom Line

About four weeks remain until Election Day, and some voters have already cast their ballots. Based on voters’ intentions as of late September, the bulk of voting should take place on Election Day. But as prior years’ polling has shown, many more voters will likely end up voting before Election Day than intended to do so weeks prior, and it could be the case that the majority of 2024 ballots are cast before Election Day.

While mail voting promises to be less common than it was during the 2020 pandemic, that method is still preferred much more by Democrats than Republicans. If absentee ballot processing and counting stretches beyond Election Day, particularly in larger cities with the greatest number of voters, the ballots counted later will likely contain more votes for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates, as occurred in 2020. Those absentee votes could be enough to push Democratic candidates over the top in closely contested elections by the time all votes are counted.",59,0.89,35,2024-10-12 08:41:22,1g1vtxm,PoliticalDiscussion,0.025,0,0

Does the US have a robust and durable constitutional system capable of filtering Trump's (or any other president's) flaws and excesses?,"[Ben Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTnV5RfhIjk&t=17s), debating Sam Harris about the 2024 election, made the following point:

""for me is is very simple: Donald Trump was a better president than Kamala Harris would be; with all Donald Trump's flaws, with all of his excesses and **because we do have a very robust and durable constitutional system, almost built to hem in his flaws and excesses, what that means is that I get a lot of good policy that I wouldn't get with Kamala Harris**.""

(this is from 11:40 to 12:30, taken from youtube's transcript)

Shapiro's point is that, even though Trump was a president with ""a rhetoric he often didn't like"" (at 11:14), and who is prone to excesses, what he calls a robust and durable constitutional system will be fully capable of taking in and filtering out such excesses; and that because of such constitutional system, Trump will be a better president, even if he is not necessarily the best candidate personally. This claim has  been corroborated frequently in this election cycle, by right wing pundits, as talking points by the media, etc. 

This is quite a strong claim to make, nonetheless. Should we judge *any* given candidate's capacity to serve *in light* of the American constitutional system? While different people may hold different views on how to evaluate a candidate, can we say *objectively* that the US's constitutional system is indeed capable of ruling out excesses effectively every time? Or is it flawed and not immune to being played? If so, what possible changes could be made?

In which ideological direction will the Republican party move if they lose? ,"If the Republican party loses and realizes they have to do some soul searching which ideological direction will they move in?

Neoconservatism - Move back to supporting foreign interventionism, not stalling aid, heavy foreign policy focus. Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel funded without questions.

Nazbol - Economically left and culturally conservative. Is there a market for working class Americans who wants a party tough on crime and against abortion, but support healthcare and social security? Latin American people seem to have some left wing economic views combined with socially conservative views.

Secular/atheist Republicans - America is getting less religious. Could the be a trend of socially conservative atheist republicans who support abortion but are still proponents of deregulation and anti-woke stuff?

""Pollsters only use landlines, and only seniors still have landlines. Therefore, polls oversample seniors, who lean Republican.""

* Trump (supposedly) hasn't gained new voters since 2020.

* Harris' bad performance in the 2020 primaries means she's likely to lose the 2024 election. Even her fellow Democrats (supposedly) don't like her!

One example of this 

In 2002 Grundy Virginia, a coal-mining town, about an hour’s drive from both Kentucky and West Virginia.   

To save the town's 1,010 residents (Down to 902 in 2019) The Army Corps had planned a $200 million flood prevention plan. 

* The Army Corps and VDOT would combine their projects for road upgrades and flood prevention and significantly reduce the costs. 
 * The 2 projects went from $350 million to $177 million.

*  VDOT will buy most of the Grundy business district at “fair market value” and demolish it to make way for an 8-foot levee built by the Army Corps
 *  Twenty tracts of land were acquired.  
* VDOT will build a new 4 lane U.S. Highway 460 on top of that levee
* A new 13-acres of businesses and residences are to be built on a mountain across the river,  
 * Process called “benching,” which requires significant cuts be made in the side of the mountain to create the land. Removing 2.3 million cubic yards of soil 
* Construction of the redevelopment included railroad relocation and construction of a highway access bridge and a pedestrian
bridge. 
*  Construction of the relocated fire station and Police Station

The next step in 2021 is a $288 million addition that is moving Grundy high school, building a wall around another learning center and the voluntary floodproofing and acquisition of additional eligible properties.

* The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced Tuesday the allocation of $235.6 million to Buchanan County and $51.3 million to Dickenson County for flood risk protection.",44,0.88,54,2024-10-07 17:38:22,1fydl4w,PoliticalDiscussion,-0.125,0,0

Curious why the Dems did a full court press tonight?,"As it sits on 270 To Win, which accounts for all major polling sources in each state.

1st pic: Kamala is leading the ""likely"" electoral votes on paper, 226-219.

2nd pic: However, with the run Trump has been on the past two weeks, all he needs is Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina to seal it.

So essentially, even if they found a way to flip Arizona (1.5% Trump lead), take Nevada (Deadlock), Wisconsin (Deadlock), and Michigan (Deadlock), it still wouldn't be enough.

Pennsylvania is looking like the big one, folks, and Trump has serged in every battleground state since Kamala's Fox News interview. Obviously it isn't over if he doesn't take Pennsylvania and any state can swing in theory, but that would be the clearest path to victory.

My neighbor is older and registered Republican.
He and my grandpa were friends and they held similar views. My sign has been up for a week or two. And while cutting the grass, he walked out of his house and started pointing at my sign, walking towards me. ""Here we go..."" I thought. But when I cut the motor, he asked ""Where did you get that?"" I told him I got it from the local Democrats Club.
Then he asked, “Do you think they'll give me one if I asked?"" | was taken aback and told him of course I would get him a sign. He thanked me and went back in his house. I was able to call my contacts and get him a sign that same day. Now with our signs, in just our neighborhood, there are
3 Harris signs and 0 Trump signs. It’s not much, but that short interaction gave me so much hope.",11608,0.92,548,2024-10-08 17:22:54,1fz5b7j,democrats,0.0,2,2

Phone banked for Georgia yesterday… ~60% of those who answered said they will vote or voted for Harris ,"I made calls yesterday for almost 3 hours. Half of the calls were hang ups but I did reach about 18 actual people who talked for a bit. 10 out of these said they were definitely either voting for Kamala or already have. 1 caller, my favorite one, actually left the call “undecided” but leaning more toward Harris. He’s a guy in his mid-20s from Mississippi originally and works in Atlanta now. We talked for about 30 min while he was driving and I had a genuine connection with him while he was explaining what was most important to him. The economy was a big point, he didn’t like how the top 1% has benefitted from so many policies (Trump’s tax cuts absolutely fueled this). He was also disappointed with the Jan 6 attempted coup and abortion bans in the south. He doesn’t necessarily buy into the “doom and gloom” messaging on the left, which I didn’t want to push because I wanted to keep the convo going, and we left with him leaning less towards trjmp and more undecided but very interested in reading more about each platform. We talked for awhile about my family and situation and what I felt would benefit the middle class by the Harris/Walz plan. Ultimately he’ll make his own decision but I felt so refreshed from this call because he’s in the demographic we all see as “hardcore” trumpies: young white men. I told him to tell all his friends to vote and he was eager to do so. I felt like if this was a troll, our call would not have lasted so long (27 min!). If you can, please volunteer to phone bank. There are a lot of people who hang up or are rude and that’s fine. I got this one caller and 10 others who gave me SO much hope. Let’s win this and reach the hearts and minds of all the regular Americans who are tired of trump and the GOP!!!
